Welcome to LASSECASH
-
Rewarding anarchy, crypto and truth.





Static inflation first 2 years (until 24/4-2021)
-
Inflation until now, per year: 1750000 LASSECASH (given 100% via proof of brain).

Dynamic inflation in the future
-
Inflation will be dynamically decided by tribe leader per the 24/4 â€“ 2021 (the first day of year 3), probably changed each year. If new stuff comes out, like DeFi on Hive Engine, then it can be changed anytime to provide the best possible features for the Tribe. Inflation is dynamically changed in a responsible way, to create the best conditions and hopefully higher prices for LASSECASH tribe token.

Per 24/4 - 2021 (the first day of year 3), the inflation schedule will be:

Notes on distribution
-

If you compare to any other tribe, then they all have a huge token supply, often issued millions or billions more then LASSECASH. This is in our view not serious, as scarcity of a token is very important for the tribemembers valutation of the token. As an example Bitcoin has 21 million max coins ever and with LASSECASH its MAX 51 millions tokens ever. In effect LASSECASH is much more scares then HIVE and all other tribes, which all have an ever expanding token supply with potentially a lot of inflation.


Scotbot parameters and liquidity rewards
-
We tweaked the parameters of the Scotbot to be more successful then HIVE and all other tribes. The powerdown time is 26 payments every 7 day over 6 months. This is made to incentivize longterm mentality. Furthermore the payout ration is 90% LASSECASH POWER and 10% LASSECASH, this is another huge difference from HIVE.

Diesel pool rewards are payout on a weekly basis, depending on how much liquidity you provide to the SWAP.HIVE/LASSECASH pool.

Lasse as leader of LASSECASH
-
Lasse Ehlers is naturally the leader of the LASSECASH tribe and will be the one to resolve any potential dispute or drama, since he has the biggest stake.
